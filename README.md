## About

**CarSpot** is a free, open-source custom app for [LB Phone](https://docs.lbscripts.com/). It turns the in-game phone into a social platform built around cars — players can post photos of their rides, follow each other, save favourite posts, manage a personal garage, create car meets and events, and compete in weekly rankings.

Designed for roleplay servers that want a lightweight, immersive car culture experience without leaving the phone UI.

## Installation

### 1. Download

Clone or download this repository into your resources folder:

```
resources/[lb-phone]/lb-phone-carspot
```

### 2. Import the database

Run the SQL file on your server database:

```
carspot.sql
```

Tables are created automatically on first start. If you are upgrading from an older version, restart the resource and the script will apply any missing columns.

### 3. Add to server.cfg

Make sure dependencies start **before** CarSpot:

```cfg
ensure oxmysql
ensure ox_lib
ensure lb-phone
ensure lb-phone-carspot
```

### 4. Configure

Open `shared/config.lua` and adjust settings to your liking (see [Configuration](#configuration) below).

### 5. Restart

Restart your server or run:

```
ensure lb-phone-carspot
```

The app will register itself inside LB Phone automatically.

## Configuration

All main settings live in `shared/config.lua`:

```lua
Config.Locale = 'en'          -- en | pt | es | fr | de | it
Config.AppName = 'CarSpot'
Config.FeedPageSize = 10
Config.EventReminderMinutes = 5
Config.RankingDays = 7
```

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `Config.Locale` | UI and server message language | `'en'`, `'pt'`, `'es'`, `'fr'`, `'de'`, `'it'`|
| `Config.FeedPageSize` | Posts loaded per feed page | `10` |
| `Config.MaxPostTitleLength` | Max characters for post titles | `80` |
| `Config.MaxCommentLength` | Max characters for comments | `200` |
| `Config.DefaultMaxParticipants` | Default event capacity | `50` |
| `Config.EventReminderMinutes` | Phone notification before event | `5` |
| `Config.RankingDays` | Days counted for weekly ranking | `7` |
| `Config.ClassicVehicleClasses` | Classes for classic ranking | `{ 'D', 'C' }` |
| `Config.SupercarVehicleClasses` | Classes for supercar ranking | `{ 'S', 'X' }` |
| `Config.OffroadVehicleClasses` | Classes for off-road ranking | `{ 'offroad', 'SUV', 'O' }` |

Framework detection is automatic — no need to set `Config.Framework` unless you want to override it.

## Locales

Translation files are located in `locales/`:

| Code | Language |
|---|---|
| `en` | English |
| `pt` | Portuguese |
| `es` | Spanish |
| `fr` | French |
| `de` | German |
| `it` | Italian |

To add a new language, create `locales/xx.lua` following the same structure as `locales/en.lua` and set `Config.Locale` accordingly.
